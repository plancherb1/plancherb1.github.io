      <title>Materiality and Risk in the Age of Pervasive AI Sensors</title>

      <description>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems connected to sensor-laden devicesare becoming pervasive, which has notable implications for a range of AIrisks, including to privacy, the environment, autonomy and more. Thereis therefore a growing need for increased accountability around theresponsible development and deployment of these technologies. Herewe highlight the dimensions of risk associated with AI systems that arisefrom the material affordances of sensors and their underlying calculativemodels. We propose a sensor-sensitive framework for diagnosing theserisks, complementing existing approaches such as the US National Instituteof Standards and Technology AI Risk Management Framework and theEuropean Union AI Act, and discuss its implementation. We concludeby advocating for increased attention to the materiality of algorithmicsystems, and of on-device AI sensors in particular, and highlight the needfor development of a sensor design paradigm that empowers users andcommunities and leads to a future of increased fairness, accountability andtransparency.</description>

      <description>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an exciting field that has enabled a wide range of cutting-edge tech-nology, from driverless cars to grandmaster-beating Go programs. The goal of this course is to introduce the ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. Topics covered in this course are broadly be divided into 1) planning and search algorithms, 2) probabilistic reasoning and representations, and 3) machine learning (although, as you will see, it is impossible to separate these ideas so neatly).</description>

      <title>MIT Beaverworks Summer Institute: Autonomous RACECAR Grad Prix</title>

      <description>Driverless vehicle technology has been growing at an exponential pace since the DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges pushed the state of the art to demonstrate what was already possible. Commercial interest and aggressive development are being driven by Google, Toyota, Tesla, Continental, Uber, Apple, NVidia, and many other companies. There is no single technology or “killer app” available to solve the myriad perception, understanding, localization, planning, and control problems required to achieve robust navigation in highly variable, extremely complex and dynamically changing environments. This summer, Beaver Works Summer Institute will offer nine teams of five students, each with its own MIT-designed RACECAR (Rapid Autonomous Complex Environment Competing Ackermann steeRing) robot, the opportunity to explore the broad spectrum of research in these areas, learn to collaborate, and demonstrate fast, autonomous navigation in a Mini Grand Prix to Move&amp;hellip; Explore&amp;hellip; Learn&amp;hellip;Race!</description>
