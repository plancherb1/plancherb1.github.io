      <description>This course explores the foundational principles of digital computing, bridging the gap between software and the physical hardware that executes it. Starting with binary representation and Boolean logic gates, students will progress through core topics in digital logic design and optimization, building towards the design of a processor and the assembly language with which it is programmed. By the end of the course, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of how software is translated into hardware operations, preparing them for future studies or careers in computer architecture, digital systems, and high performance computing.</description>
