      <title>RoboARCH: Robotics Acceleration with Computing Hardware and Systems</title>

      <description>Roboticists are increasingly leveraging heterogeneous deployments across edge and cloud infrastructures and integrating and co-designing robotics algorithms for specific computing hardware ranging from CPUs, to GPUs, to FPGAs, to MCUs, and even to custom accelerator ASICs (e.g., Neuromorphic processors). As such, a key challenge for the field of robotics in the future will be to determine not only the right allocation of algorithms to computer hardware and the right combination of heterogeneous computer hardware onboard robotic systems to balance performance with power, but also the right software engineering practices and paradigms to broaden access to these advanced approaches across the robotics community. As such, this workshop is designed to build a welcoming community and ignite innovation and collaboration at the exciting intersection of robotics and computer software, systems, and architecture, focusing on the development of advanced robotic systems through cutting-edge computational solutions for the benefit of all.</description>

      <title>RoboARCH: Workshop on Robotics Acceleration with Computing Hardware</title>
      <link>https://plancherb1.github.io/courses/roboarch@micro-24/</link>

      <description>Robotics is pushing the limits of conventional computing. This is a call to action for researchers across academia and industry: we must leverage nontraditional computing hardware (e.g., custom accelerator ASICs, FPGAs, and GPUs) and navigate enormous design spaces spanning across algorithms, hardware, and physical robot parameters in order to design new high performance systems enabling critical tasks in robotics. This workshop aims to gather pioneers and innovators working at the intersection of robotics and computer architecture, and to provide an introduction to this exciting emerging field to the computer architecture community.</description>
