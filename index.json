We describe our implementation strategy and present results demonstrating its performance compared to an equivalent multi-threaded CPU implementation using several benchmark control tasks. Our results suggest that GPU-based solvers can offer increased per-iteration computation time and faster convergence in some cases, but in general tradeoffs exist between convergence behavior and degree of algorithm-level parallelism.","tags":["Model Predictive Control","Differential Dynamic Programming","Parallel Computing","GPU"],"title":"A Performance Analysis of Parallel Differential Dynamic Programming on a GPU","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brian Plancher"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
