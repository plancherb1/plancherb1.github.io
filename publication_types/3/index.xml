      <description>This paper introduces and formalizes the problem of Robust Task Networking Under Attrition (RTNUA), which extends connectivity maintenance in multi-robot systems to explicitly address proactive redundancy and attrition recovery. We introduce Physics-Informed Robust Employment of Multi-Agent Networks (ΦIREMAN), a topological algorithm leveraging physics-inspired potential fields to solve this problem. Through simulation across 25 problem configurations, ΦIREMAN consistently outperforms the DCCRS baseline, and on large-scale problems with up to 100 tasks and 500 drones, maintains &amp;gt;99.9% task uptime despite substantial attrition, demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability.</description>

      <title>Solving Quadratic Programs with Slack Variables via ADMM without Increasing the Problem Size</title>

      <description>We propose a simple ADMM scheme to tackle QPs with slack variables without increasing the size of the original problem. The only modification is a slightly different projection in the z-update, while the rest of the algorithm remains standard. We prove that the method is equivalent to applying ADMM to the QP with additional slack variables, even though slack variables are not added. Numerical experiments show speedups of the approach.</description>

      <title>HJCD-IK: GPU-Accelerated Inverse Kinematics through Batched Hybrid Jacobian Coordinate Descent</title>

      <description>We introduce HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid Inverse Kinematics (IK) solver that combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent initialization scheme with a Jacobian-based polishing routine. This design enables our solver to improve both convergence speed and overall accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art, consistently finding solutions along the accuracy-latency Pareto frontier and often achieving order-of-magnitude gains. In addition, our method produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples, yielding the lowest maximum mean discrepancy. We release our code open-source for the benefit of the community.</description>

      <title>Polynomial and Parallelizable Preconditioning for Block Tridiagonal Positive Definite Matrix</title>

      <description>The efficient solution of moderately large-scale linear systems arising from the KKT conditions in optimal control problems (OCPs) is a critical challenge in robotics. With the stagnation of Moore’s law, there is growing interest in leveraging GPU-accelerated iterative methods, and corresponding parallel preconditioners, to overcome these computational challenges. To improve the performance of such solvers, we introduce a parallel-friendly, parametrized multi-splitting polynomial preconditioner framework. We first construct and prove the optimal parametrization theoretically in terms of the least amount of distinct eigenvalues and the narrowest spectrum range. We then compare the theoretical time complexity of solving the linear system directly or iteratively. We finally show through numerical experiments how much the preconditioning improves the convergence of OCP linear systems solves.</description>
