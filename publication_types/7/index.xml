      <description>This work presents a model for a modular course, seated outside the traditional classroom, from which students and faculty can pick-and-choose the material that is relevant to their interests, doing so in a flexible way that is not obstructed by a list of prerequisite units. Guidance for maintaining accessibility, generality, and module independence accompanies a provided content map. This work culminates in a demonstration of a proof-of-concept aligned to the recommendations made along the way.</description>

      <title>GPU Acceleration for Real-time, Whole-body, Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>This dissertation address the computational challenges of whole-body, nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) by exposing, analyzing, and leveraging the structured sparsity and parallelism patterns found in the underlying numerical optimization and rigid body dynamics algorithms. Through careful algorithmic refactoring and re-design, this work exploits these patterns to enable real-time MPC performance through GPU-acceleration. It also validates the feasibility of this approach in the presence of model discrepancies and communication delays between the robot and GPU by deploying the resulting implementations onto a physical manipulator arm. Overall, this dissertation finds that GPU acceleration can provide nearly order-of-magnitude speedups, and open-sources its implementations to aid the wider robotics community in accelerating both robotics computations and application development timelines.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning to Enable Robust Robotic Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://plancherb1.github.io/publication/levthesis/</link>

      <description>This thesis proposes a novel algorithm, “Reference-Guided, Value-Based MPC,” which combines model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) to compute feasible trajectories for a robotic arm. The algorithm does this while 1) achieving an almost 50% higher planning success rate than standard MPC, 2) solving in sparse environments considered unsolvable by current state of the art algorithms, and 3) generalizing its solutions to different environment initializations.</description>

      <title>Parallel and Constrained Differential Dynamic Programming for Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://plancherb1.github.io/publication/mastersthesis/</link>

      <description>This thesis builds on recent work on Unscented Dynamic Programming (UDP)—which eliminates dynamics derivative computations in DDP—to support general nonlinear state and input constraints to high precision using an augmented Lagrangian. It then leverages parallel computations for increased throughput and systematically analyzes the insights, challenges, tradeoffs, and benefits of implementing a parallelized variant of DDP on both a multi-core CPU and a graphics processing unit (GPU).</description>

      <title>Hacking the White House: Election Fraud in the Digital Age</title>
      <link>https://plancherb1.github.io/publication/undergradthesis/</link>

      <description>This thesis is an exploration of not only how credible the threat of a stolen election is given the voting systems operating in the United States today, but also in what ways a theoretical attack might take place and what protective measures can be implemented to prevent an attack. This thesis concludes that: paper trails and audits are effective measures to radically increase the difficulty of attack, future systems need to be designed to balance privacy, usability, transparency and cost, voter education is a vital part of any security strategy, and safeguards against insider influence on the voting process can greatly hinder the scalability of an attack. Elections can be made quite secure if these conclusions are considered, followed and implemented.</description>
