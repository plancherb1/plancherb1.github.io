      <title>GRiD: GPU-Accelerated Rigid Body Dynamics with Analytical Gradients</title>

      <description>We introduce and release GRiD, an open-source, GPU-accelerated library for computing rigid body dynamics with analytical gradients. GRiD was designed to accelerate nonlinear trajectory optimization Through optimized code generation, GRiD provides as much as a 7.6x speedup over a state-of-the-art, multi-threaded CPU implementation and maintains as much as a 2.6x speedup when accounting for I/O overhead.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Robot Dynamics Gradients on a CPU, GPU, and FPGA</title>

      <description>In this paper, we detail the designs of three faster than state-of-the-art implementations of the gradient of rigid body dynamics on a CPU, GPU, and FPGA. Our optimized FPGA and GPU implementations provide as much as a 3.0x end-to-end speedup over our optimized CPU implementation by refactoring the algorithm to exploit its computational features, e.g., parallelism at different granularities.</description>

      <title>Realtime Model Predictive Control using Parallel DDP on a GPU</title>

      <description>In this extended abstract we extend our previous work by using our Parallel DDP implementation for MPC on a physical Kuka arm. We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in the presence of model discrepancies and communication delays between the robot and GPU and found that higher control rates generally lead to better tracking performance across a range of parallelization options.</description>

      <title>A Performance Analysis of Parallel Differential Dynamic Programming on a GPU</title>

      <description>We analyze the benefits and tradeoffs of higher degrees of parallelization using a multiple-shooting variant of DDP implemented on a GPU. We describe our implementation strategy and present results demonstrating its performance compared to an equivalent multi-threaded CPU implementation using several benchmark control tasks. Our results suggest that GPU-based solvers can offer increased per-iteration computation time and faster convergence in some cases, but in general tradeoffs exist between convergence behavior and degree of algorithm-level parallelism.</description>

      <title>Constrained Unscented Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://plancherb1.github.io/publication/cudp/</link>

      <guid>https://plancherb1.github.io/publication/cudp/</guid>
      <description>We build on recent work on Unscented Dynamic Programming (UDP) - which eliminates dynamics derivative computations in DDP - to support general nonlinear state and input constraints using an augmented Lagrangian. The resulting algorithm has the same computational cost as first-order penalty-based DDP variants, but can achieve constraint satisfaction to high precision without the numerical ill-conditioning associated with penalty methods.</description>
